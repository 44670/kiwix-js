	<div id="about" style="display: none;">
	This is a preliminary work on the port of Evopedia (offline wikipedia reader) in HTML5/Javascript, with Firefox OS as the primary target
	<br />
	The original application is at <a href="http://www.evopedia.info/">http://www.evopedia.info/</a>
	<br />
	<br />
	To use it, you have to first download locally a dump from <a href="http://dumpathome.evopedia.info/dumps/finished">http://dumpathome.evopedia.info/dumps/finished</a> (with a Bittorrent client).
	<br />
	<ul>
	<li>On desktops, it works on recent Firefox and Chrome, and maybe on other browsers. In this case, you have to select manually some files from your dump (see below)</li>
	<li>On the Firefos OS simulator, you have to put the archive files in a "fake-sdcard" folder of your firefox profile (ex : ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxx.default/extensions/r2d2b2g@mozilla.org/profile/fake-sdcard). It looks for file titles.idx in it. You need to install the application from the dashboard of the simulator (due to security restrictions in Firefox OS : only certified webapps can access the sdcard)</li>
	<li>On a real Firefox OS device, you simply have to put the archive files anywhere in your sdcard, so that it finds titles.idx on it. For now, the application has to be installed manually (use the push feature of the Firefos OS Simulator)</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	It's still a beta version : there are many many ways this could be enhanced (suggestions and patches are welcome : the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/mossroy/evopedia-html5">github</a>). In particular :
	<ul>
	<li>The performance has to be optimized when searching titles and reading an article</li>
	<li>Some searches (for example with prefix "a" on the French dump) do not give any result even if they should</li>
	<li>In some cases, the links inside an article do not work, or do not lead to the right article</li>
	<li>It is not easy to use on the Peak device from Geeksphone because the buttons and inputs are too small</li>
	<li>Some features of the original application still have to be implemented : in particular geolocation of articles</li>
	</ul>
	The <a href="https://github.com/mossroy/evopedia-html5/issues">bugtracker</a> is on github too.
