                    Evopedia : offline wikipedia viewer
                    </h2>
                    <br />Official site : <a href="http://www.evopedia.info/" target="_blank">http://www.evopedia.info/</a>
                    <br />
                    <br />You can search among the article titles, and read any of them without any Internet access.
                    <br />All the content of wikipedia is inside your device (except the images). It also works with Wiktionary and Wikivoyage.
                    <br />If your Internet access is expensive/rare/slow/unreliable/watched/censored, you still can browse this amazing amount of knowledge and culture.
                    <br />
                    <br />NB : If you're connected to the Internet when using the application, the images of the articles will be displayed from the Internet.
                    <h3>Usage</h3>
                    <h4>Step 1 : download an archive</h4>
                    From <a href="http://dumpathome.evopedia.info/dumps/finished" target="_blank">http://dumpathome.evopedia.info/dumps/finished</a>, with a regular computer.
                    <br />If you get a compressed archive (.zip, .tar.gz or .tar.bz2), you will have to decompress it.
                    <br />For a quick test, you can start with the dump called <a href="http://evopedia.info/dumps/wikipedia_small_2010-08-14.tar.gz" target="_blank">"small"</a> : it contains a very small subset of the English archive (note that the hyperlinks between articles will rarely work, as a lot of articles are missing in it).
                    <br />After that, you can download an archive in your language, through a Bittorrent client. Check its size : these archives take several GB each.
                    <h4>Step 2 : put it on your SD-card</h4>
                    The archive can be stored is any subdirectory of your SD-card (ex: /wikipedia_small_2010-08-14, or /evopedia/wikipedia_small_2010-08-14). If you have enough space, you can put several archives
                    <h4>Step 3 : enjoy wikipedia offline!</h4>
                    <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
                    This application works offline. There is no central server. We do not collect any of your personal data and don't even know what you are doing with this application.
                    <br />Anyway, if you think your Internet access can be watched and/or if you are paranoid, you should shut down your 3G and Wifi access before using the application. If not, the application will try to read the images of the articles on the wikipedia servers, which might indicate which articles you are reading.
                    <br />This application only reads the wikipedia archives of your SD-card : it does not read any other files.
                    <h3>Feedback / helping / contributing</h3>

                    <br />
                    <br />This HTML5/javascript application is currently mainly targeted on Firefox OS devices. But it also can be used on some other platforms :
                    <ul>
                        <li>It works perfectly on the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/" target="_blank">Firefos OS simulator</a> (a Firefox plugin), you have to put the archive files in any subdirectory in a "fake-sdcard" folder of your firefox profile (ex : ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxx.default/extensions/r2d2b2g@mozilla.org/profile/fake-sdcard/wikipedia_small_2010-08-14)</li>
                        <li>On desktops, it works but is less user friendly : you have to manually select the files of your archive, and it's not yet easily deployable as a "web application". I tested it on recent Firefox and Chromium, but it probably works on some other browsers (it even seems to work on IE10). You can test on <a href="http://mossroy.github.io/evopedia-html5/" target="_blank">this online page</a> or from a local copy of the <a href="https://github.com/mossroy/evopedia-html5" target="_blank">source code</a></li>
                        <li>On Android, it does not seem to work for now (tried with internal browser, Chrome and Firefox) because you can not select all the files of an archive</li>
                        <li>On Android and desktops, the DeviceStorage API (which is used to browse the SD-card for archives) should become available at some point (see <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=WebAPI" target="_blank"> https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=WebAPI</a>). As soon as it is, I will update the application to make it available on these platforms</li>
