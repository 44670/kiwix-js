==============

Evopedia is an offline wikipedia viewer. See the official site : http://www.evopedia.info/
This application is developed in HTML5/Javascript, with Firefox OS as the primary target.
It also works on Android (since Firefox 34) but suffers from a major bug : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1117136.

You can install the latest stable version from the Mozilla Marketplace : https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/evopedia/

You can search among the article titles, and read any of them without any Internet access.
All the content of wikipedia is inside your device (except the images). It also works with Wiktionary and Wikivoyage.
If your Internet access is expensive/rare/slow/unreliable/watched/censored, you still can browse this amazing amount of knowledge and culture.
A "serch nearby" feature can also list articles found around your location (after geolocating your device)

It uses wikipedia archives located at http://dumpathome.evopedia.info/dumps/finished
You have to first download one of them (with a Bittorrent client) and store it on your SD-card (or internal storage).
