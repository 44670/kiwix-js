kiwix-html5
==============

Kiwix is an offline wikipedia viewer. See the official site: http://www.kiwix.org/

This is a browser extension developed in HTML5/Javascript.

You can search among the article titles, and read any of them without any Internet access.
All the content of wikipedia is inside your device (including the images).
It might also works with other content in the OpenZIM format: http://www.openzim.org/wiki/OpenZIM , but has been only tested on the wikipedia ones.

If your Internet access is expensive/rare/slow/unreliable/watched/censored, you still can browse this amazing amount of knowledge and culture.

It uses ZIM files that you can download from http://download.kiwix.org/
You have to download them separately, store them in your filesystem, and manually select them after starting the application.
It is unfortunately not technically possible to "remember" the selected ZIM file and open it automatically (the browsers refuse that for security reasons).

This application is released under the GPL v3 license. See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ or the included LICENSE-GPLv3.txt file
The source code can be found at https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-html5
Unit tests can be run by opening tests.html file on Firefox.

The first versions of this application were originally part of the Evopedia project: http://www.evopedia.info (now discontinued)
These first versions were targeting Firefox OS (now discontinued too : we're not lucky ;-) ).
